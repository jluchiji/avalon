Avalon.js is a visual novel engine that attempts to redefine the way visual
novels are created, distributed and played. It harnesses the power of the
bleeding edge web technologies to deliver a platform that is fully-featured,
open source, hackable and flexible beyond belief.


This project is in early development.
